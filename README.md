# Webapp Runner

Webapp runner is designed to allow you to launch an exploded or compressed war that is on your filesystem into a tomcat container with a simple `java -jar` command.

## Usage

### Clone and Build

    git clone git@github.com:jsimone/webapp-runner.git
    mvn package

### Execute

    java -jar target/webapp-runner.jar path/to/my/project

or

    java -jar target/webapp-runner.jar myProject.war

### Help

    java -jar target/webapp-runner.jar help

Prints out all arguments accepted

## Using with Maven in your project

You can use the Maven dependency plugin to download webapp-runner as part of your build. This will eliminate the need for any external dependencies other than those specified in your build to run your application.

### pom.xml

Add the following to your pom.xml:

    ...
    <repositories>
      <repository>
        <id>webapp-runner-repo</id>
        <name>webapp runner repository on GitHub</name>
        <url>http://jsimone.github.com/webapp-runner/repository/</url>
      </repository>
    </repositories>
    ...
    <build>
    ...
      <plugins>
          <plugin>
              <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
              <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
              <version>2.3</version>
              <executions>
                  <execution>
                      <phase>package</phase>
                      <goals><goal>copy</goal></goals>
                      <configuration>
                          <artifactItems>
                              <artifactItem>
                                  <groupId>com.github.jsimone</groupId>
                                  <artifactId>webapp-runner</artifactId>
                                  <version>0.0.7</version>
                                  <destFileName>webapp-runner.jar</destFileName>
                              </artifactItem>
                          </artifactItems>
                      </configuration>
                  </execution>
              </executions>
          </plugin>
      </plugins>
    ...
    </build>

### launching

Now when you run `maven package` webapp runner will be downloaded for you. You can then launch your application with:

     $ java -jar target/dependency/webapp-runner.jar target/<appname>.war

## Running your application in Eclipse

Since your application will just be a standard webapp you can still use WTP and the traditional Tomcat integration points to run your application within Eclipse. However the containerless nature of webapp runner allows you to run from within Eclipse in a simpler way.

Start by importing your project into Eclipse. It is best to import it as an existing Maven project using the [m2eclipse plugin](http://eclipse.org/m2e/).

### Make your application dependant on webapp runner

Add the following dependency to your pom.xml:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.jsimone</groupId>
      <artifactId>webapp-runner</artifactId>
      <version>0.0.7</version>
      <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>

This will cause Eclipse to include webapp-runner on the classpath of your project so that it can be used for launching. It won't affect the final artifact built for your application.

### Create a launch configuration

1. Right-click on your project and choose 'Debug As -> Debug Configurations...'
2. From the 'Debug Configuration' window create a new 'Java Application' launch configuration by double-clicking on 'Java Application' in the left hand list or right-clicking on it and selecting 'New'
3. Give your launch configuration a sensible name. Then enter the name of your project in the 'Project' box
4. Enter 'webapp.runner.launch.Main' in the 'Main Class' box
5. Click on the 'Arguments' tab and enter './src/main/webapp' in the 'Program Arguments' box
6. Click 'Apply' and then 'Run'

Your application should start and you should see the log output in the Eclipse console. Since you have a debugger attached to your application you'll now see changes to your code get automatically loaded without restarting and can set breakpoints.

You can stop the application from the red square in the console pane or from the debug perspective. It can be restarted by right-clicking on the project and choosing your new launch configuration from the 'Debug As' menu or from the debug menu in the Eclipse toolbar (the icon with the little bug).

# Webapp Runner [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/heroku/webapp-runner/tree/main.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/heroku/webapp-runner/tree/main) [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.heroku/webapp-runner/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.heroku/webapp-runner)

Webapp runner is designed to allow you to launch an exploded or compressed war that is on your filesystem into a tomcat container with a simple `java -jar` command. It supports the following version of Tomcat:

+  Tomcat 7.x: [tomcat7](https://github.com/heroku/webapp-runner/tree/tomcat7) branch (deprecated)
+  Tomcat 8.0: [tomcat8.0](https://github.com/heroku/webapp-runner/tree/tomcat8.0) branch (deprecated)
+  Tomcat 8.5: [main](https://github.com/heroku/webapp-runner/tree/main) branch
+  Tomcat 9.x: [tomcat9](https://github.com/heroku/webapp-runner/tree/tomcat9) branch

## Notice: Group ID Change

Please note that this project was previously published under the `com.github.jsimone` group id.
If you want to install a version <= `8.5.47.2` you must use the old group id.

## Using with Maven in your project

You can use the Maven dependency plugin to download webapp-runner as part of your build. This will eliminate the need for any external dependencies other than those specified in your build to run your application.

### pom.xml

Add the following to your pom.xml:

```xml
<build>
...
  <plugins>
      <plugin>
          <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
          <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>2.3</version>
          <executions>
              <execution>
                  <phase>package</phase>
                  <goals><goal>copy</goal></goals>
                  <configuration>
                      <artifactItems>
                          <artifactItem>
                              <groupId>com.heroku</groupId>
                              <artifactId>webapp-runner</artifactId>
                              <version>${webapp-runner.version}</version>
                              <destFileName>webapp-runner.jar</destFileName>
                          </artifactItem>
                      </artifactItems>
                  </configuration>
              </execution>
          </executions>
      </plugin>
  </plugins>
...
</build>
```

### Excluding Memcached and Redis libraries

Webapp-runner bundles Memcached and Redis client libraries into it's fat-jar package.
These libraries can cause conflicts with similar libraries in your application.
This frequently manifests itself as a `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError`.

If you do not require these client libraries (because you are storing session data in some other way),
You can exclude them by using `webapp-runner-main`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.heroku</groupId>
  <artifactId>webapp-runner-main</artifactId>
  <version>${webapp-runner.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

In most cases, this `groupId` and `artifactId` can be substituted for `com.heroku:webapp-runner`.

### Launching

Now when you run `maven package` webapp runner will be downloaded for you. You can then launch your application with:

     $ java -jar target/dependency/webapp-runner.jar target/<appname>.war

## Store your sessions in memcache

In versions 7.0.29.1 and newer support for a [session manager that stores sessions in memcache](https://github.com/magro/memcached-session-manager) is built in.

To use it add `--session-store memcache` to your startup command:

    $ java -jar target/dependency/webapp-runner.jar --session-store memcache target/<appname>.war

Then make sure that three environment variables are available for configuration: MEMCACHE_SERVERS, MEMCACHE_USERNAME, MEMCACHE_PASSWORD

## Store your sessions in redis

In versions 7.0.29.1 and newer support for a [session manager that stores sessions in redis](https://github.com/redisson/redisson) is built in.

To use it add `--session-store redis` to your startup command:

    $ java -jar target/dependency/webapp-runner.jar --session-store redis target/<appname>.war

Then make sure that Redis environment variable is available for configuration: REDIS_URL

## Using Tomcat behind a reverse proxy server

If you are using webapp-runner behind a proxy server, you can set the proxy base url within tomcat:

    $ java -jar target/dependency/webapp-runner.jar --proxy-base-url http://example.com  target/<appname>.war

If you pass an HTTPS base url, e.g. https://example.com, secure flag will be automatically added to session cookies. This indicates to the browser that cookies should only be sent over a secure protocol.


## Running your application in Eclipse

Since your application will just be a standard webapp you can still use WTP and the traditional Tomcat integration points to run your application within Eclipse. However the containerless nature of webapp runner allows you to run from within Eclipse in a simpler way.

Start by importing your project into Eclipse. It is best to import it as an existing Maven project using the [m2eclipse plugin](http://eclipse.org/m2e/).

### Make your application dependent on webapp runner

Add the following dependency to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.heroku</groupId>
  <artifactId>webapp-runner</artifactId>
  <version>8.5.11.3</version>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

This will cause Eclipse to include webapp-runner on the classpath of your project so that it can be used for launching. It won't affect the final artifact built for your application.

### Create a launch configuration

1. Right-click on your project and choose 'Debug As -> Debug Configurations...'
2. From the 'Debug Configuration' window create a new 'Java Application' launch configuration by double-clicking on 'Java Application' in the left hand list or right-clicking on it and selecting 'New'
3. Give your launch configuration a sensible name. Then enter the name of your project in the 'Project' box
4. Enter 'webapp.runner.launch.Main' in the 'Main Class' box
5. Click on the 'Arguments' tab and enter './src/main/webapp' in the 'Program Arguments' box
6. Click 'Apply' and then 'Run'

Your application should start and you should see the log output in the Eclipse console. Since you have a debugger attached to your application you'll now see changes to your code get automatically loaded without restarting and can set breakpoints.

You can stop the application from the red square in the console pane or from the debug perspective. It can be restarted by right-clicking on the project and choosing your new launch configuration from the 'Debug As' menu or from the debug menu in the Eclipse toolbar (the icon with the little bug).

### Maven Central
Note: webapp runner is now available in Maven Central. The version scheme has also changed to match the version of
Tomcat that it relies on. The format is `<tomcat version>.<minor webapp runner version>`.

### Using without Memcached or Redis

The default packaging of Webapp Runner (`com.heroku:webapp-runner`) includes
client libraries for Memcached and Redis so they can easily be used for session storage.
If you do not require these dependencies, you can alternative use the
`webapp-runner-main` packaging thusly:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.heroku</groupId>
  <artifactId>webapp-runner-main</artifactId>
  <version>${webapp-runner.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

If you are encountering `NoClassDefFoundError` or other conflicts in dependency
versions, this may resolve your problem.

### Development

To run the entire suite of integration tests, use the following command:

```
$ mvn clean install -Pintegration-test
```

To run an individual integration test, use a command like this:

```
$ mvn clean install -Pintegration-test -Dinvoker.test=memcache-test
```
